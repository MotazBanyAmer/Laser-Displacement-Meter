Review:
    ☐ where we stopped?! @critical 

Project:
    Readmap:
        ☐ Timer
        ☐ Logger
        ☐ Timeout
        ☐ EEPROM

    Todo: 
        ☐ add check laser at the start of the code


Log:
    - moved "laser def" and "laser func" to "B707C" .h and .cpp
    - moved Serial tweeks from "common.h" to "app config"
    - moved "checkRespText" from "common.h" to "app common"
    - moved "doneLaser" and "errorLaser" from "GPRS_def" to "B707C"
    - Compiled successfully
    - working on cleaning the unsued variables, checked on the old code and the new one
    - Removed unused variables, Compiled successfully
    - will try build minimum working laser/B707C code in main
    - moved "initProject" from "old main code" to "app common"
    - commented "Timer Setup" in te appCommon in "InitProject", to be worked on later
    - compiled! note commented items in init projects(buzzer and timer)
    - did commit and push
    - testing!
    - found missing member function of "waitResp_Dist"
    - after fixing the missing function, the laser worked!
    - commit and push
    - need to work on improving the way the library is built.
    - got rid of the defines for laser data modes and commands, and used class enums
    - used enum class instead of defines in laser funciton for modes and controls
    - used static casting
    - compiler successfully, commit and push
    - NEW section, Timers
    - moved melodies
    - moved timer config 
    - created timeout files
    - created central files
    - created commit checkpoint1
    - alot of errors, working on solving them
    - trasnfered melodies into OO
    - working on isses in device melodies
    - almost solved copilation errors
    - added output path Arduino JSON, to save compilation time
    - compiled successfully! converted some variable to structs and put some variables as inline
    - now to use the timer in the main code
    - created errors and logger files
    - moved central errors from laser files to errors file. this shoud be inherited later
    - compiled successfully
    - commit and push
    - worked though and solved issues and compiled
    - uploaded the code for testing, testing the logger, it works and I have made updates and upgrades
    - added indentation for logging
    - added common counter and ref number
    - currently Im having issues with main code. the laser is enabled twice I dont know why
    - the problem is in the code but I cant find it!!!!
    - problem sovlved by moving the fag clear to the end of the statment, dont know why but it worked
    ☐ - stopped here, next is to improve the laser class, and maybe the logger class, and maybe to add indentation to the printed data associated with the current loging stack
    - worked on the logging system 
    - having issue, the system keeps restarting , still dont know where
Ideas:
    ☐ Think of what you can make of laser/B707C constructor.
